# COMPX301AssignmentThree
BM (Boyer-Moore) string search algorithm for plain-text

# Requirement classification
The output of the BMSearch is based on the requirement:
"This program performs the string search, and accepts two filenames as command-line arguments; the first being the name of the file with the skip array, and the second being the plain text file to search through. The output should be every line of the text that contains the string; but just once, regardless of how many times the target string occurs in that line (e.g. same as default behaviour of Unix grep command)."
The entire line that the match string is found on is prited to the console/terminal and not a sepperate file.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run this project, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### 1. MakeBMTable

This program generates the skip array (bad-character table) for a given search string and writes it to a specified output file.

**Compilation:**

``` 
javac MakeBMTable.java
``` 
Execution:

Bash
``` 
java MakeBMTable <input_text> <output_file_path>
``` 
<input_text>: The string for which the skip array will be constructed. This will be the pattern you want to search for later.
<output_file_path>: The path to the file where the generated skip array will be saved.
Example:

Bash
``` 
java MakeBMTable "example" skip_array.txt
``` 
This will create a file named skip_array.txt containing the skip array for the word "example".

2. BMSearch
This program searches for a target string in a given text file using a pre-generated skip array.

Compilation:

Bash
``` 
javac BMSearch.java
``` 
Execution:

Bash
``` 
java BMSearch <skip_array_file> <text_file>
``` 
<skip_array_file>: The path to the file containing the skip array, generated by MakeBMTable.java.
<text_file>: The path to the plain text file to search through.
Example:

Bash
``` 
java BMSearch skip_array.txt document.txt
``` 
This command will search for the string defined in skip_array.txt (e.g., "example") within document.txt and print every line that contains the string.

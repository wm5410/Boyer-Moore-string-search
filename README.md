# COMPX301AssignmentThree
BM (Boyer-Moore) string search algorithm for plain-text

# Requirement classification
The output of the BMSearch is based on the requirement:
"This program performs the string search, and accepts two filenames as command-line arguments; the first being the name of the file with the skip array, and the second being the plain text file to search through. The output should be every line of the text that contains the string; but just once, regardless of how many times the target string occurs in that line (e.g. same as default behaviour of Unix grep command)."
The entire line that the match string is found on is prited to the console/terminal and not a sepperate file.
